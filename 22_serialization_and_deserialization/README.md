## Serialization and deserialization
Serialization is a core language feature in the era of web applications. When one program needs to talk to another program over the Internet, it needs to serialize its data into a format that can be transmitted through the network. The receiving program uses deserialization to reconstruct the data.

In Rust, most applications use the [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) crate to manage serialization and deserialization. In this, we will cover how to serialize typed Rust data into [JSON strings](https://rust-by-example-ext.com/serde/json.html) or [byte arrays](https://rust-by-example-ext.com/serde/bincode.html). We will also discuss how to serialize third party structs in libraries.
