## Cryptography with openssl
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is an widely used open source library to perform cryptographic operations. We can use it to encrypt, decrypt, digest, and sign data, as well as to make SSL/TLS secure connections through the Internet.

In this one, we will cover the `openssl` crate. You can [read more documentation about it](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.29/openssl/).
