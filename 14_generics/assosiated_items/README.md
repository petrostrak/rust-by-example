## Associated Items
"Associated Items" refers to a set of rules pertaining to [items](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items.html) of various types. It is an extension to `trait` generics, and allows traits to internally define new items.

One such item is called an *associated type*, providing simpler usage patterns when the trait is generic over its container type.
