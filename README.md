## Rust by Example
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and check out the [official docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/).

This is the final code of the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

• Hello World - Start with a traditional Hello World program.
• Primitives - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers and other primitives.
• Custom Types - struct and enum .
• Variable Bindings - mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.
• Types - Learn about changing and deﬁning types.
• Conversion
• Expressions
• Flow of Control - if / else , for , and others.
• Functions - Learn about Methods, Closures and High Order Functions.
• Modules - Organize code using modules
• Crates - A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Learn to create a library.
• Cargo - Go through some basic features of the oﬃcial Rust package management

• Attributes - An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item.
• Generics - Learn about writing a function or data type which can work for multiple
types of arguments.

lifetimes.
• Traits - A trait is a collection of methods deﬁned for an unknown type: Self
